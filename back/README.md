# y-websocket-server :tophat:
> Simple backend for [y-websocket](https://github.com/yjs/y-websocket)

The Websocket Provider is a solid choice if you want a central source that
handles authentication and authorization. Websockets also send header
information and cookies, so you can use existing authentication mechanisms with
this server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `y-websocket-server` is intended as a **development server** or as a
> **starting point** for building your own backend. It is intentionally small
> and easy to read - fork it, copy it, or adapt `setupWSConnection` into your
> own Node server.
>
> For a production-ready backend with persistence, scaling, authentication,
> presence, webhooks, and more, look at one of the full-featured providers:
>
> * [YHub](https://github.com/yjs/yhub) - the official Yjs backend
> * [Hocuspocus](https://tiptap.dev/hocuspocus) - batteries-included backend
>   from the Tiptap team
> * See the [Yjs docs](https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider)
>   for a full list of connection providers.

## Quick Start

### Install dependencies

```sh
npm i @y/websocket-server
```

### Start a y-websocket server

This repository implements a basic server that you can adopt to your specific use-case. [(source code)](./src/)

Start a y-websocket server:

```sh
HOST=localhost PORT=1234 npx y-websocket
```

### Client Code:

```js
import * as Y from 'yjs'
import { WebsocketProvider } from 'y-websocket'

const doc = new Y.Doc()
const wsProvider = new WebsocketProvider('ws://localhost:1234', 'my-roomname', doc)

wsProvider.on('status', event => {
  console.log(event.status) // logs "connected" or "disconnected"
})
```

## Websocket Server

Start a y-websocket server:

```sh
HOST=localhost PORT=1234 npx y-websocket
```

Since npm symlinks the `y-websocket` executable from your local `./node_modules/.bin` folder, you can simply run npx. The `PORT` environment variable already defaults to 1234, and `HOST` defaults to `localhost`.

### Persistence

Documents live in memory by default and are lost when the server restarts.
Persistence is now configured **programmatically** rather than through an
env variable. Import `setPersistence` from `@y/websocket-server/utils` and
plug in any storage backend that implements `bindState` and `writeState`:

```js
import { setPersistence } from '@y/websocket-server/utils'

setPersistence({
  bindState: async (docName, ydoc) => {
    // Called when a Y.Doc is first accessed.
    // Load the persisted state for `docName` and apply it to `ydoc`.
    //
    // It is recommended to also subscribe to `ydoc.on('update', update => ...)`
    // here so you can persist updates incrementally as they happen, rather
    // than only on shutdown.
  },
  writeState: async (docName, ydoc) => {
    // Called when the last connected client disconnects from this document
    // (i.e. the session is closing). Flush / persist any remaining state.
  }
})
```

If you need durable, production-grade persistence, use YHub or Hocuspocus
instead of rolling your own.

### Websocket Server with HTTP callback

Send a debounced callback to an HTTP server (`POST`) on document update. Note that this implementation doesn't implement a retry logic in case the `CALLBACK_URL` does not work.

Can take the following ENV variables:

* `CALLBACK_URL` : Callback server URL
* `CALLBACK_DEBOUNCE_WAIT` : Debounce time between callbacks (in ms). Defaults to 2000 ms
* `CALLBACK_DEBOUNCE_MAXWAIT` : Maximum time to wait before callback. Defaults to 10 seconds
* `CALLBACK_TIMEOUT` : Timeout for the HTTP call. Defaults to 5 seconds
* `CALLBACK_OBJECTS` : JSON of shared objects to get data (`'{"SHARED_OBJECT_NAME":"SHARED_OBJECT_TYPE}'`)

```sh
CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/ CALLBACK_OBJECTS='{"prosemirror":"XmlFragment"}' npm start
```
This sends a debounced callback to `localhost:3000` 2 seconds after receiving an update (default `DEBOUNCE_WAIT`) with the data of an XmlFragment named `"prosemirror"` in the body.

## Docker

A `Dockerfile` is included for convenience. Build and run:

```sh
docker build -t y-websocket-server .
docker run -p 1234:1234 y-websocket-server
```

The container binds to `::` (all interfaces) on port `1234` by default.
